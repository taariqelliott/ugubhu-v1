# Ugubhu

Ugubhu is a desktop music player built with **Electron**, **React**, and **Howler.js**, inspired by my love for music and the nostalgia of the legendary Winamp player.

As a music lover who grew up with Winamp’s iconic visuals, dedicated music storage, and rich organization tools, I wanted to bring that feeling back — but with a modern tech stack and a cleaner, more customizable experience.
